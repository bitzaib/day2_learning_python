#A variable is a container that stores data (a value) so you can use it later in your program.
name = "bitzaib"
#name = label (variable name)
#"bitzaib" = value stored inside 
#instead of writing values again and again , we store them once and use them later in code
#example 
age = 19
print (age) 
print (age+10)
